# Maternal-health
So our project is on maternal health and as part of the solution creteria one has to incorparate africas talking ussd, sms, voice and airtime apis. 
Our problem statement is that women on the streets do not get the vital information on maternal health . They get raped and their kids end up being street kids or dying mostly due to lack of guidance. 
So we came up with Salum our maternal heaalth care initiative to help women in the streets . So we send sms to them once they dial our ussd . Vital information on the trimesters, support and join a community that will help them.
