  <p1>  Maternal health encompasses the well-being of pregnant women and new mothers, covering their physical, emotional, and social needs. Adequate prenatal care, skilled childbirth assistance, and postpartum support are vital for ensuring safe pregnancies and positive outcomes for both mothers and newborns. Despite progress, maternal mortality rates remain a concern in areas with limited healthcare access. Efforts worldwide are aimed at reducing these rates and promoting comprehensive maternal care to improve the health and future prospects of women and their children. </p1>
